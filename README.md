**FULL ARTICLE UNDER SUBMISSION**: Lars van Rengs, Katrijn Smulders, Brenda E. Groen, and Noël L. W. Keijsers: Can anterior-posterior acceleration impulse from a single, lumbar-mounted IMU serve as a surrogate for propulsion force impulse in healthy and post-stroke individuals?

<br>

This repository contains algorithms and datasets for gait analysis using both IMU (Inertial Measurement Unit) and OMCS (Optical Motion Capture System) data.
It includes validated algorithms, walking trial datasets from healthy individuals and post-stroke individuals, as well as scripts for data analysis.

<br>

**📂 IMU_GaitAnalysis [1]**

Contains the IMU-based gait analysis algorithm developed and validated by C. Ensink.
This folder also includes datasets from various walking trials with 20 healthy individuals and 10 post-stroke individuals.

<br>

**📂 MovingReality [2]**

Contains datasets from walking trials with 12 post-stroke individuals.

<br>

**📂 OMCS_GaitAnalysis**

Contains the algorithm for OMCS-based gait analysis.

<br>

**📂 Statistics**

Contains RStudio-script and dataset used for data analysis of this study.

<br>

**📄 OMCS_StepByStepDataframe.py**

Creates a dataframe with OMCS gait data for the left and right leg (df_left.pkl and df_right.pkl) and saves them to the working directory.
* Each row represents a step of a subject.
* Spatiotemporal metrics are organized in columns.
* Steps are linked using initial contact (IC) and terminal contact (TC) events, enabling step-by-step comparison between legs.

<br>

**📄 main_APacceleration.py**

Extends the OMCS step-by-step dataframe by adding anterior-posterior (AP) acceleration impulses and peaks calculated from IMU data.

<br>

**📄 helpers_APacceleration.py**

Contains helper functions that are used by main_APacceleration.py.

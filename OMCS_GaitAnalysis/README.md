# OMCS based gait analysis
Gait analysis based on optical motion capture, including the option for forceplate data analysis.


**📄 readmarkerdata.py**

Imports markerdata from c3d file and if present also forceplate data.


**📄 gaiteventdetection.py**

Calculates gait events (initial contact, terminal contact).


**📄 gaitcharacteristics.py**

Calculates gait characteristics (gait speed, gait cycle duration, stance time, swing time, stride length, AP-propulsion).
